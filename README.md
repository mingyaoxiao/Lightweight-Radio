# Lightweight-Radio
A music player that opens and plays your music fast, without the lag of opening up Youtube or Pandora on a new tab!

(Actually, this is an experiment, and I am unsure if there is any speedup or the degree of speedup and load on the machine)

# Future Improvements
-  Be able to download from Youtube
-  Be able to download playlists
-  Be able to tag songs and playlists
-  Be able to search for songs by name and tags and channel
-  Have a config file that lets you authenticate, define root song folder
